## Bakers App

A website created with React that will allow bakers to create recipes and adjusted
ingredients, as well as serving sizes, on the fly. 

To use:

Create an account, then log in with your account. 
Use the button near the top to add a new recipe, add a title and serving size, then add an ingredient (ex 1 cup flour) and click to add the ingredient. Continue adding ingredients until you are satisfied and then submit the recipe. 

You can then delete, edit, or change the serving size of the recipe using the buttons beside each recipe. If you update the serving size, it will recalculate the ingredient amounts as well.
